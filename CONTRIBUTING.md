Contributing to Linky
======================

As an open source project, Linky welcomes contributions of many forms.

Examples of contributions include:

- Code patches
- Documentation improvements
- Bug reports and patch reviews

For extensive contribution guidelines, please shoot me a dm at @makumazakpe on twitter

https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/internals/contributing/

**Warning: non-trivial pull requests (anything more than fixing a typo) without
Trac tickets will be closed!** `Please file a ticket`\_\_ to suggest changes. -->

<!-- Linky uses Trac to keep track of bugs, feature requests, and associated
patches because GitHub doesn't provide adequate tooling for its community.
Patches can be submitted as pull requests, but if you don't file a ticket,
it's unlikely that we'll notice your contribution. -->

# Code of Conduct
